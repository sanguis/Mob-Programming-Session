# Mob Programming

## Josh Beauregard

Senior DevOps Engineer for GreenPages

Note: That has nothing to do what I am talking about.



# Previous role

DevOps Consultant
AT Division of HUIT

Note: In 2016 I spent the year as a DevOps Consultant working for Harvard University
I worked for The AT a department that serves the faculty at Harvard and assists with making digital teaching tools.



## Mobbed Projects

### Omeka as a Service

This was a shared hosting service that set up instances of the Omeka CMS.

Note: Ran on a LEMP stack.



## Mobbed Projects

### The Digital Toolkit

A Linux machine that included heaps of odd research tools on it.



# This Session

* A Case Study of how Mob Programming helped build this tool.
* A Demo

Note: This will be a case study with a demo following my talk.
Amongst other projects I worked on there we 2 major projects that I worked on. I will need some help from people for this so be ready to step up.



# My challenges

## University Culture

Note: Universities are incredibly autonomous everyone gets what they want when they want.



# My challenges

## New Tech

* Ansible
* Omeka
* Insane Tools

Note: I had always used Chef for CMS. And Terraform for orchestration. The part of I worked forHarvard Used Ansible and CFT of then had to. I had never seen Omeka or the plethora of Software that was needed for the toolkit.



![XP](./xp.png)

Note: There are various forms of extreme programming, Swarming and Pairing, and more. I had head of Mob Programming created by Woody Zuil. So I thought lets try it.  Also Note When I say programming I also mean scripting and anything that involves a thought process and a text editor.



# Mob Programming sold as:

> "All the brilliant minds working together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer"

# Coding Dojo

Practice and Skill building

Note: These clubs that get together and do exercises that people partake in  to challenge themselves and grow as developers. But they are not used as production code developing teams.



# What does this look like

# What Does this Look Like

Note: What you see here is a Navigator and a Driver.   The driver is paying attention to the road and implementing what the navigator is prescribing.   This is how mob programing works.



# Driver/Navigator

Note: One person, the driver sits at computer and types whatever the other person says. It could be wrong  but we will cover that. With rally racing you can see the entire map from the beginning and create your route.




## The rest of the folks



Note: With programming the map becomes more visible as one works, thatâ€™s where everyone else comes in.  While the current navigator is looking toward road and what is around the next bend. The rest of the people are looking at what is developing on the horizon.



## Anyway...

(sorry I got distracted)

Note: I will be focussing on the Digital Tookkit




## People Resources wise I had

* Myself, A contracted DevOps Consultant.
* A Badass Full time full stack ninja who did not know good operations practices.
* A full time staff member who knew how to use all these tools.
* A bunch of others somewhere in between all of the three of us.



### Ansible?

Note: I realized that non of us had the whole picture. None of us had used Ansible before.


### Digital Toolkit

Note: We met weekly. We learned about all these crazy tools. on the box
